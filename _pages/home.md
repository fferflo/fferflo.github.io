I am a postdoc working at [Fraunhofer IOSB](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Karlsruhe. I previously completed my PhD with [Prof. Rainer Stiefelhagen](https://cvhci.iar.kit.edu/people_596.php) from [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) and [Prof. Bastian Leibe](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/person/1/) from [RWTH Aachen](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/).

My work lies at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. My ongoing research focuses on image-based localization utilizing large-scale, geo-referenced world models.
